# Mongee CLI

This CLI allows you to copy data between Mongo databases.
It encrypts your passwords via a master password so your passwords are stored securely. If you prefer to not store them at all, you don't have to.

NOTE:
Currently it's more like an MVP. It could potentially be released on NPM if I feel like it's good enough. Right now it's just a project I decided to make public for fun.
